# What's New

We have plans for additional feature, but we want to hear from you! What features would you like? You can send us feedback by emailing <contact@gratedate.app>.

Here is the current feature set for version 1.0 available on the Apple App store.

### Rate your Date 

-	Rate each date using the core questions on a 1-5 scale. Select no emoji to give that question a rating of 0. These questions have been curated by psychologists to help you identify and measure core relationship values. 

### Journaling and keeping track 

-	Use the notes/journal section to write down facts or notes about the people you date. Remember if your date is a dog lover, only talked about themselves, or is allergic to pizza. 

### Compare dates

-	Once you have rated two or more different people you can see how they compare to each other. How do your dates stack up?

### Analyze the trends 

-	The analysis screen shows you how a person is trending. It compares your most recent date with them against their overall score. 

### Identify your dating goals 

-	You have unique dating goals. Identify what they are and see if your dates are meeting your goals and living up to your expectations. 

### GET INSPIRED 

-	A quote every day feeds your brain.
